# SymmetricCryptoBench---AES-Blowfish-Twofish-Performance-Signed-Messaging
A React web application that benchmarks symmetric (secret‑key) ciphers (AES, Blowfish, Twofish) using CPU and memory metrics, and provides a secure message-sending demo with digital signatures using ad‑hoc (self‑signed) certificates.
